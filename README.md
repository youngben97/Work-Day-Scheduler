# Work Day Scheduler

This repo containes code for a work day scheduler.

When the scheduler is opened, the user sees the current day displayed at the top of the page. Below the header are separate sections for each hour of an eight hour work day (in this case, 9-5). The user will see that any hours passed will be colored gray, while the current hour is red, and any future hours are green. The user can write input in any of these sections and click the blue button to save to local storage. When the page is refreshed, the user's input persists.

I began with starter code provided by the University of Utah coding bootcamp. I added functions that:
 - Display the current date using DayJS.
 - Save the input and the ID of the div to local storage upon click.
 - Apply the premade CSS classes based on time of day and a data attribute specific to the div.
 - Get information from local storage and apply it to each div.
